"Excited to share my recent project using Power BI to look at why some employees leave a company! 🚀💼

🔍Key Things I Found:
1.Different Departments, Different Stories: Noticed that attrition (people leaving) isn't the same in every part of the company. Some areas have different challenges.
2.Money Matters: When people get a pay raise, they are more likely to stick around. So, paying people well is a good strategy.
3.Education Insights: Found out that people with different educational backgrounds might leave for different reasons. It's important to understand these differences.
4.Age Matters: Different age groups face different issues at work. Understanding these helps in keeping everyone happy.

📈 What I Learned and How It Helps:
This project isn't just about looking at charts. It's about understanding what makes people stay or leave and using that knowledge to make the workplace better.
